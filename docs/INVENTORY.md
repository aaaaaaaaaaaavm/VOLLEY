# Inventory

Complete index of the work. Read alongside `PROVENANCE.md`.

**Baseline:** nothing in this list has been validated by hardware, FEA, or third-party
review. Every entry is a model output or a design decision, and several superseded
entries are kept only so the record of what changed stays legible.

## E. Open problems

Full detail in `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`. Summary: P1, P4 are errors in the published paper
(conjunction minimum, peak current, stray far-field, fin temperature), corrected in
`paper.tex`, though P11 asks whether those corrections reached the submitted build.
P5, P10 come out of the CAD build, and P12 records two places where the paper's prose
contradicts it, including an ESPA-Grande envelope claim the CAD does not support. E1, E18 are unsolved engineering, of which the
load-bearing ones are 3-D field closure, the absence of FEA and hardware, and the
patent position now that disclosure has happened.

## F. External sources

30 sources cited across the work; 21 were fetched and read directly ("verified"), the
remainder cited without retrieval and **should be re-checked before publication**. Full
list with verification status is in the paper bibliography and `PROVENANCE.md`. Three
references (eddy-damper heritage, Yudintsev, vibro-impact deployment) remain explicitly
unverified, see `OPEN_PROBLEMS.md` E16.
