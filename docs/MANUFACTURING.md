# Manufacturability

The Engineering Programme Dossier names manufacturability three times, in the Phase I focus
list, in the philosophy (*"manufacturability over elegance"*), and in the validation chain.
Until 2026-07-29 this repository contained none. This document opens it.

Status: analysis only. Nothing has been quoted, no vendor has been approached, and no part
has been made. Every price and process tolerance below is an assumption, marked as such
under E16, exactly like `analysis/cost.py`.

## 1. The airgap tolerance stack: the finding

`sizing.py` declares a single `gap_shim_tolerance = 0.05 mm` against a thrust sensitivity of
13.1 %/mm, and reports a resulting spread of ±0.65 %. That figure counts only the shim.
It does not count the parts.

Three separate budgets were being conflated. Separated:

| # | Budget | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Physical clearance per side | 1.000 mm | `parameters.json` `sled.airgap_per_side` |
| 2 | A4 deflection band per plate | 0.025 mm | measured 0.0194, 78 % used |
| 3 | Shim setting spec | ±0.050 mm | to ±0.66 % thrust |
| 4 | Build stack | never computed | below |

### The build stack

| Contributor | Assumed (mm) | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Track straightness over 1.8 m | 0.060 | Dominant. A 1.8 m extruded/machined Al assembly |
| Ti plate flatness over 488 mm | 0.050 | Post-machining, pre-shim |
| Roller / rail radial clearance | 0.040 | Bearing fit plus rail form |
| Magnet block thickness tolerance | 0.030 | Sintered NdFeB, ground faces |
| Chassis web height tolerance | 0.030 | |
| Bond line thickness variation | 0.020 | Adhesive under 12 blocks |
| Shim setting | 0.020 | The only term currently counted |
| RSS | 0.101 | to 1.33 % thrust |

Combined with A4's deflection bias (0.0194 mm, always closing) the total gap error is
0.121 mm, 2.4x the ±0.65 % currently claimed, giving ±1.58 % thrust spread.

### What this does and does not mean

It is not a contact risk. 0.121 mm against 1.000 mm of clearance is 12 %; nothing touches.

It is a claims problem. ±1.58 % thrust spread propagates into the open-loop velocity
spread, which the paper states as ±2.1 % RSS from manufacturing terms. That figure was built
from magnet grade, gap, resistance and ESR, with the gap term taken as the ±0.05 mm shim
rather than the real stack. The closed-loop servo collapses delivered dispersion regardless
(ADR-014), so the headline 0.0274 m/s survives. But the open-loop number is optimistic and
should be restated once these contributors are replaced with real ones.

The individual values above are assumed. The useful output is the ranking: track
straightness and plate flatness dominate, and no amount of shim precision fixes either.
Tightening the shim spec is the intuitive move and it is nearly worthless.

## 2. Halbach assembly: the hazardous operation

`analysis/cost.py` puts the magnet set at only ~5 % of recurring cost. It is far more than
5 % of the risk.

Each array is 12 blocks of N45SH in alternating orientation, and the two opposed arrays attract
across the gap with 2.69 kN (P17's corrected 3-D figure; the flat-plate formula says 3.67).
That is roughly 274 kgf trying to close a 12 mm gap, acting on brittle sintered material with
essentially no tensile strength.

Process implications, none of which are in the CAD:

- Assembly fixture must be non-magnetic and must control the gap throughout closure, not
  only at the end. There is no intermediate state where the halves are "nearly together" and
  safe.
- A controlled-approach mechanism is required, screw-driven or similar. Free approach ends
  in an impact between two brittle arrays.
- Keep-out during assembly. 2.69 kN closing on a hand is a serious injury.
- Magnetisation order. Magnetise-then-assemble is standard for Halbach arrays but makes
  every handling step hazardous; assemble-then-magnetise needs equipment most shops lack.
  Not yet decided, and it changes the fixture completely.
- Bond cure under load: the bond line is a stack contributor (§1) and cures while the
  attraction is trying to squeeze it.

This is the single largest manufacturability unknown in the project, and it is not
represented in cost, schedule, or the qualification plan beyond T-3's magnet-integrity check.

## 3. Make versus buy

Driven by `analysis/cost.py`, whose sensitivity table is the relevant output:

| Item | Share | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Avionics, sequencer, IMU | 23.7 % | Buy. Nothing here is VOLLEY-specific |
| Supercapacitor bank | 17.8 % | Buy cells, make the pack, cell selection is commodity, the pack is not |
| SiC bridge + gate drive | 13.3 % | Buy the modules, make the busbar |
| Halbach arrays | ~5 % | Buy magnetised blocks, assemble in-house: see §2 |
| Ti chassis, track longerons | ~11 % | Make (subcontract machining). This is where DFM effort pays |
| Bearings, rails | 5.2 % | Buy. Vacuum-rated hybrid ceramics are catalogue items |

The strategic point: the project's cost and risk both concentrate in electronics and
assembly process, not in the electromagnetics the design effort has gone into.

## 4. DFM review of the Gen3 parts

| Part | Observation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Chassis plate 488x140x6 | Drawn solid. A4 gives a 17x stress margin, so this is not a structural part, it is a stiffness part carrying dead mass | Pocketing is PII-2. Do not thin uniformly: deflection goes as 1/t³ |
| Track longerons, 1.8 m | Straightness dominates the tolerance stack (§1) | Specify straightness explicitly. It is currently unspecified anywhere |
| Halbach blocks | 12 per array, alternating orientation | Orientation-proof fixturing. A reversed block is invisible on inspection and destroys K<sub>t</sub> |
| Roller channels, guide flanges | G3-D2: not modelled at all. The rollers have nothing to run in | Blocking for any real build |
| Halbach array position | G3-D5: not re-centred after the chassis grew 360 to 488 mm | Array-to-winding position is what K<sub>t</sub> depends on. Blocking, and it may invalidate K<sub>t</sub> independently of A1 |

```

Inspection points that do not currently exist: a gap map along the full 1.3 m stroke rather
than a single measurement, and a K<sub>t</sub> check on the built article. Both are in
`docs/BENCHTOP_TESTS.md` as B-1 and B-2 at sub-scale.

## 6. What would close this

1. Real tolerance data. Quote the seven contributors in §1 against actual process
   capability. Until then §1 is structure, not a number.
2. A decision on magnetisation order (§2). It changes the fixture, the hazard case and the
   schedule.
3. G3-D2 and G3-D5 (§4). Both are blocking for a build and G3-D5 may move K<sub>t</sub>.
4. One quotation: any line item. `cost.py` currently has zero real prices, and a single
   quote would tell us whether the model is out by 20 % or by 200 %.

## Where this sits in the validation chain

Dossier §7: Concept to Analysis to Simulation to Prototype to Experiment to Repeatability to Manufacturability to Flight Qualification.

The project sits at Simulation. This document is the first entry on the manufacturability
rung, and it is analysis about manufacturing rather than manufacturing evidence. The rung is
opened, not climbed.
